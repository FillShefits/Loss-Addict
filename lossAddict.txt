Loss Addict

There ain't a rhytm, ain't a sound
That would set myself in motion,
Cause I lost what I have found,
When ignoring my emotions.

My legs are numb, my throat is tight,
Yet I keep on walking, breathing...
Maybe just out of that spite.
Maybe I still like that living.

It feels so good, when my depression
Puts on pause surrounding madness,
Hands me pen and tells me: "Listen,
Here's how we describe our sadness..."

And I write what she's dictating.
There's no point of thinking whether
I should or shouldn't be obeying,
When obviously she knows me better.

Right now she is telling me to
Forgive life its meaninglessness,
To accept that it's all a re-do
Of what has been done in advance.

But it's hard, God, don't you get it?
To accpet that I don't matter,
To shrug my shoulders and just admit
That everything will once shatter.

That whatever shit I'm doing
Is as random as it's pointless...
Sometimes I believe it's bullshit.
Other times I think it's nonsense.

But perhaps there's silver lining
Carved into my "world" called prison.
There's a truth to what I'm writing
And perhaps you are the reason.
